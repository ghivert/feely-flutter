# Messagely

Messagely is a simple Flutter project, aiming to teach me good programming practices in Flutter and Dart. It has no goal otherwise learning Flutter. It is neither production-ready, nor will never be. Of course, it has not to be closed-source. Youâ€™re free to enjoy the work, use it to learn, play with it, build stronger bases, etc. Just remember to say thanks, I love receiving sweet words!

# Getting Started

As it is a simple Flutter project, you can get started easily. Below are some resources to get you started into Flutter development.

[You obviously need to install Flutter.](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) It consists in one folder you can unzip anywhere and just point your path to the `bin` folder. Youâ€™re good to continue.

Run `flutter doctor`. It is an amazing tool whichâ€™ll help you install everything needed. Remember to install XCode and Android Studio. You also have some dependencies you need to get with Homebrew. Donâ€™t be afraid, everything works smoothly.

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ghivert/messagely.git
```

Once youâ€™re done, launch your text editor, and run `flutter run` in your terminal (or do your stuffs if youâ€™re using Code or Android Studio).

Youâ€™ll maybe have to configure an emulator. You can create one easily using `Simulator` in macOS or Android Studio.

Enjoy!

# Resources

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

# Naming

One final point about naming. The application is named Messagely, a contraction of Message and the -ly suffix. Because at [Wolfox](https://wolfox.co), we strongly believe every word finishing with -ly is way more beautiful and cute than itâ€™s normal version.

# Looking for Flutter opportunities?

Weâ€™re looking for Flutter developers at Wolfox, to work on private and clients projects. Donâ€™t hesitate to mail me if you want more information. Weâ€™re mainly focused on web and application projects, but weâ€™re real geeks, and love trying and using awesome languages and frameworks, like PureScript, ClojureScript, Haskell, Scala, Flutter, Elm, Functional JS and all the things cool kids love!
